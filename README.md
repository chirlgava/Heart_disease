# Credit_card
 This is a classification machine learning problem to detect fraudulent purshases.<br>
 This code is heavly based on the code made by janiobachmann from kaggle, if you want a more in depth explanation, please go to his notebook,<br>
 my objective here is to learn from janiobachmann and others to solve this problem and them apply the earned skills and methodology on another dataset.
## Challenges
This is a very clean dataset, however it has a very uneven amount of fraudulent and non fraudulent data and this can very easly skew the algorithm
## Code and Resources Used 
**Python Version:** 3.9  <br>
**Packages:** ipykernel,pandas,numpy,sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn <br>
**Requirements:**  ```pip install -r requirements.txt```  <br>
